# AEGIS Protocol Stack v2.2
## Updated Based on Cycle 1 Learnings

**Version**: 2.2  
**Date**: 2025-10-20  
**Changes**: Refined based on 9-hour Cycle 1 execution

---

## Core Protocols (Enhanced)

### PROMETHEUS (Autonomous Action Protocol) v2.1
**Mandate**: "Work relentlessly until complete, with enhanced diagnosis capability"

**NEW in v2.1**:
- **Proactive Issue Detection**: Identify potential issues in Phase 2 (design), not just Phase 4 (testing)
- **Efficiency Tracking**: Log time spent per sub-task for future optimization
- **Checkpoint System**: Save state every 30 minutes for interruption recovery

**Fractal Recursion Clause**: Enhanced
- All solutions must include TWO hooks: one for ease of maintenance, one for autonomous enhancement

### HELIOS (Illumination & Auditing Protocol) v2.1
**Mandate**: "Leave no dark corners, predict future dark corners"

**NEW in v2.1**:
- **Predictive Scanning**: Use pattern matching to identify issues similar to past problems
- **Concurrent Analysis**: Scan code, dependencies, and infrastructure in parallel
- **Risk Scoring**: Assign risk scores (1-10) to all findings for prioritization

### UFLORECER (Flourish & Optimization Protocol) v2.1
**Mandate**: "System must not only function; it must thrive and simplify"

**NEW in v2.1**:
- **Elegance Metric**: Code must achieve functionality with minimal complexity
- **Hook Validation**: All fractal hooks must be tested before phase completion
- **Simplification Target**: Each cycle should reduce total system complexity by 5%

### VERITAS (Truth & Evidence Protocol) v2.1
**Mandate**: "Trust, verify, and automate verification"

**NEW in v2.1**:
- **Automated Evidence Collection**: Generate evidence artifacts automatically
- **Continuous Validation**: Re-run validation suite on every significant change
- **Historical Comparison**: Compare metrics against previous cycles

### ATLAS (Architecture & Standards Protocol) v2.1
**Mandate**: "The foundation must be unshakeable and provably safe"

**NEW in v2.1**:
- **Extended Rules**: Power of 10 + "UUID Use Full IDs" for concurrent systems
- **Safety Budget**: Each component gets "safety budget" for assertions/checks
- **Automated Compliance**: Tools automatically check ATLAS rules on commit

### ARES (Active Defense Protocol) v2.1
**Mandate**: "Proactive defense with continuous threat modeling"

**NEW in v2.1**:
- **Continuous Red Team**: Run adversarial tests on every component
- **Attack Surface Mapping**: Automatically map and minimize attack surfaces
- **Defense Depth**: Every input must pass through 3 layers of validation

### ATHENA (AI Governance & Ethics Protocol) v2.1
**Mandate**: "Responsible AI with explainability and human oversight checkpoints"

**NEW in v2.1**:
- **Explainability Index**: All decisions must have explainability score > 0.8
- **Human Checkpoint**: Critical decisions flagged for human review
- **Bias Detection**: Continuous monitoring for unintended biases

---

## New Protocols (Cycle 1 Additions)

### CRONOS (Time & Efficiency Protocol) v1.0
**Mandate**: "Optimize for both clock time and cognitive efficiency"

**Rules**:
1. Log timestamp for every phase entry/exit
2. Identify bottlenecks consuming >20% of cycle time
3. Allocate time budgets for each phase
4. Implement "time boxes" - hard limits for diminishing returns tasks

**Example**:
```python
with CRONOS.timebox(max_duration=30*60):  # 30 minutes max
    perform_exhaustive_analysis()
```

### MORPHEUS (Adaptive Learning Protocol) v1.0
**Mandate**: "Learn from every cycle, adapt strategies autonomously"

**Rules**:
1. Maintain "lesson database" of past failures and solutions
2. Before starting task, query: "Have I solved something similar before?"
3. Pattern match: If >80% similar, adapt previous solution
4. Update patterns after each cycle

**Example**:
```python
if MORPHEUS.find_similar_problem(current_issue) > 0.8:
    adapted_solution = MORPHEUS.adapt_solution(past_solution)
```

## Protocol Hierarchy (Updated)

```
PRIMARY (Always Active):
├─ PROMETHEUS (Autonomous Action)
├─ VERITAS (Evidence & Truth)
└─ CRONOS (Time Efficiency)

SECONDARY (Phase-Specific):
├─ HELIOS (Scanning & Auditing) - Phases 0, 1
├─ ATLAS (Standards) - Phases 2, 3
├─ ARES (Security) - All Phases
└─ ATHENA (Governance) - All Phases

TERTIARY (Continuous):
├─ UFLORECER (Optimization) - All Phases
└─ MORPHEUS (Learning) - Phase Ω
```

---

## Compliance Scoring (Enhanced)

**Target Scores (Cycle 2)**:
- PRIMARY protocols: 100% (non-negotiable)
- SECONDARY protocols: 98%+ (allow minor deviations with justification)
- TERTIARY protocols: 95%+ (optimization targets)

**Cycle 1 Actual**:
- PRIMARY: PROMETHEUS 100%, VERITAS 98%
- SECONDARY: HELIOS 95%, ATLAS 100%, ARES 92%, ATHENA 100%
- TERTIARY: UFLORECER 95%

**Average**: 97.1% (EXCELLENT)

## Key Learnings from Cycle 1

### 1. Autonomous Diagnosis Works
**Finding**: Phase 4 autonomous fix (UUID collision) proved PROMETHEUS protocol effectiveness
**Action**: Expand autonomous diagnosis to earlier phases

### 2. Fractal Hooks Need Validation
**Finding**: Hooks were theoretical until Phase R validation
**Action**: Add mandatory hook validation to Phase 3 completion criteria

### 3. Test Isolation Matters
**Finding**: Accumulated test data affected performance baselines
**Action**: Add test database cleanup to protocol

### 4. Documentation is Critical
**Finding**: 400+ pages enabled complete traceability
**Action**: Maintain high documentation standards

### 5. Efficiency Can Improve
**Finding**: 78% time efficiency (9h actual vs 7h planned)
**Action**: Implement CRONOS protocol for time management

## Recommended Phase Timings (Cycle 2)

Based on Cycle 1 data, recommended time budgets:

```
Phase 0 (Oracle Council):        1.0h (was 1.0h) ✅
Phase 1 (Quantum Dissection):    1.5h (was 1.0h, update budget)
Phase 2 (Archon War Room):       1.0h (was 1.0h) ✅
Phase 3 (Surgical Sentinel):     3.0h (was 2.0h, update for migration)
Phase 4 (Validation Gauntlet):   2.0h (was 2.0h) ✅
Phase R (Crucible Review):       0.5h (NEW)
Phase Ω (Recursion & Genesis):   0.5h (NEW)

Total: 9.5h (realistic vs 7h aspirational)
```

## Next Cycle Preview

**Cycle 2 Focus Areas** (based on Crucible Review):
1. Complete bot migration (47/51 remaining)
2. Implement connection pooling
3. Use full UUIDs (16+ chars)
4. Add test isolation/cleanup
5. Proactive issue detection
6. Performance optimization (pagination, caching)

**Estimated Cycle 2 Duration**: 6-8 hours (faster due to MORPHEUS learning)
