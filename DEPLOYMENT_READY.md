## ⚡ EASIEST WAY - Vercel Dashboard (1-Click)

**This requires ZERO terminal commands:**

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your project (search for `prj_PuVHxIAY2NpoqKdZ7QptUw6HIFIz`)
3. Click the **"Redeploy"** button (top right)
4. Wait 2-3 minutes
5. Done! ✅

**IMPORTANT:** After first deploy, go to:
- Settings → General → Root Directory → Set to `dashboard` → Save
- Then click "Redeploy" again

---

## 🖥️ OR Use Terminal (If You Prefer)

### Step 1: Install Vercel CLI (if not installed)

```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

### Step 2: Deploy

```bash
cd dashboard
vercel --prod --project-id="prj_PuVHxIAY2NpoqKdZ7QptUw6HIFIz"
```

Vercel will:
- Ask you to login (opens browser)
- Upload your code
- Build on their servers  
- Deploy to production
- Give you the URL

## ⚙️ CRITICAL: Configure After Deployment

Once deployed, **you must do this**:

### 1. Set Root Directory

In Vercel Dashboard:
- Go to: Settings → General
- **Root Directory:** `dashboard`
- Click **Save**
- Click **Redeploy**

**WHY:** This tells Vercel where your Next.js app lives.

### 2. Add Environment Variables (Optional)

If you want to connect to a real API:

- Go to: Settings → Environment Variables
- Add:
  ```
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
  NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=https://your-api-server.com
  ORGANISM_API_URL=https://your-api-server.com
  ```
- Click **Redeploy**

**NOTE:** Dashboard works with mock data if no API is connected!

---

## 🎯 What Will Happen

### After Deployment:

1. ✅ Build completes (~2 min)
2. ✅ Dashboard live at your Vercel URL
3. ✅ No 404 errors
4. ✅ `/api/health` returns `{"status":"ok"}`
5. ✅ Dashboard shows mock data (or real data if API connected)

## 🐛 IF 404 ERROR PERSISTS

**After deploying**, if you still get 404:

### Quick Fix:

1. Vercel Dashboard → Settings → General

**This fixes 99% of 404 errors!**
