## 🚀 Quick Start: 5 Steps to Profitability

### Step 1: Add Guardrails (30 minutes)

```bash
# Create guardrails module
mkdir -p modules/guardrails
```

Copy code from `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` Section 1:
- `modules/guardrails/pre_trade.py` ✅
- `modules/guardrails/portfolio.py` ✅

**This prevents you from blowing up your account!**

### Step 2: Add Trading Rules (30 minutes)

Copy code from `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` Section 2:
- `modules/rules/engine.py` ✅

**This ensures disciplined trading!**

### Step 3: Add Strategies (1-2 hours)

Copy code from `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` Section 3:
- `modules/strategies/trend_following.py` ✅
- `modules/strategies/mean_reversion.py` ✅

**This gives you the edge!**

### Step 4: Backtest (1 day)

```python
# Test on 2+ years of historical data
python3 modules/backtesting/run_backtest.py \
    --strategy trend_following \
    --start 2022-01-01 \
    --end 2024-12-31
```

**Must pass these criteria:**
- ✅ Sharpe Ratio > 1.5
- ✅ Win Rate > 40%
- ✅ Max Drawdown < 20%
- ✅ Profit Factor > 1.5

### Step 5: Paper Trade (1 month)

```python
# Run in simulation with real-time data
python3 tps19_main.py --mode simulation --live-data
```

**Monitor daily:**
- Daily P&L
- Trade quality
- Rule compliance
- Guardrail triggers

## 💰 Expected Returns

### Conservative (Recommended Start)

```
Strategy Mix: 60% Trend Following, 40% Mean Reversion
Expected Annual Return: 15-25%
Max Drawdown: 10-12%
Win Rate: 45-50%

Example:
$10,000 → $11,500 - $12,500 (Year 1)
Risk: $1,000 - $1,200 max drawdown
```

### Moderate

```
Strategy Mix: All strategies active
Expected Annual Return: 30-50%
Max Drawdown: 15-18%
Win Rate: 50-55%

Example:
$10,000 → $13,000 - $15,000 (Year 1)
Risk: $1,500 - $1,800 max drawdown
```

### Aggressive (Not Recommended Initially)

```
Strategy Mix: Heavy momentum/breakouts
Expected Annual Return: 60-100%
Max Drawdown: 20-25%
Win Rate: 55-60%

Example:
$10,000 → $16,000 - $20,000 (Year 1)
Risk: $2,000 - $2,500 max drawdown
```

**⚠️ Start conservative, prove it works, then scale up!**

## 🛡️ Critical Guardrails (MUST HAVE)

### Level 1: Before Every Trade

```python
✅ Daily loss < 5%
✅ Weekly loss < 10%
✅ Drawdown < 15%
✅ Max 5 positions
✅ Position size ≤ 10%
✅ Confidence ≥ 65%
✅ Volume sufficient
✅ No consecutive 5+ losses
```

**If ANY fail → NO TRADE**

### Level 2: During Trades

```python
✅ Stop loss at -2%
✅ Take profit: 25% at +3%, 25% at +6%, 25% at +10%
✅ Trail remainder
✅ Time stop: 5 days if no profit
✅ Monitor correlation
```

### Level 3: Portfolio Level

```python
✅ Max 20% portfolio at risk
✅ Max 25% in single asset
✅ If drawdown > 10%: reduce sizes 50%
✅ If drawdown > 15%: STOP TRADING
```

### Level 4: Emergency Stops

```python
🚨 Flash crash (>10% drop in 10 min) → Close all
🚨 API errors (>5 in 1 min) → Stop trading
🚨 7 losses in a row → Pause & review
🚨 Unusual P&L (>20% swing in 1 hour) → Investigate
```

## 📊 Strategy Cheat Sheet

### When to Use Each Strategy

| Market Condition | Strategy | Entry | Win Rate | R/R |
|-----------------|----------|-------|----------|-----|
| **Strong Uptrend** | Trend Following | MAs aligned, momentum+ | 40-45% | 1:3 |
| **Sideways** | Mean Reversion | Oversold, at BB lower | 60-65% | 1:1.5 |
| **Consolidation** | Breakout | BB squeeze, volume dry | 35-40% | 1:4 |
| **High Volatility** | Arbitrage | Price differences | 80-90% | 1:1 |
| **Strong News** | Momentum | Volume spike, social buzz | 50-55% | 1:2.5 |

### Quick Decision Tree

```
Is trend clear and strong?
├─ YES → Trend Following
└─ NO → Is market ranging?
    ├─ YES → Mean Reversion
    └─ NO → Is volatility low?
        ├─ YES → Wait for Breakout
        └─ NO → Arbitrage or Stay Cash
```

## 🎯 Position Sizing (Kelly Criterion)

### Formula

```
Optimal Size = (Win% × Avg Win - Loss% × Avg Loss) / Avg Win × 0.5

Example:
Win Rate: 50%
Avg Win: 6%
Avg Loss: 2%

Kelly = (0.5 × 0.06 - 0.5 × 0.02) / 0.06 = 0.333
Half Kelly = 0.333 × 0.5 = 16.6%
```

### Practical Sizing

```python
Base Size (from Kelly): 16.6%
× Confidence (0.75): 12.4%
× Volatility Adjust (0.8): 9.9%
Apply Max Limit (10%): 9.9%
Apply Min Limit (2%): 9.9%

Final Position: 9.9% of portfolio
```

**Never risk more than 2% on any single trade!**
