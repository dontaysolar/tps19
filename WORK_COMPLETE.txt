⚠️  IMPORTANT REMINDER:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

This is a cryptocurrency trading system. Always:
  • Test in simulation mode first
  • Understand the risks
  • Start with small amounts
  • Monitor constantly
  • Have an exit strategy

Cryptocurrency trading involves substantial risk of loss.
Use at your own risk. Not financial advice.
