## üîß ISSUES FIXED

### 1. ‚úÖ Patch Manager Test Failure - RESOLVED
**Problem**: Hardcoded path `/opt/tps19/test_patch_file.txt` causing file not found errors  
**Solution**: Updated to use dynamic `self.system_dir` path  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Test now passes - rollback system fully operational

### 2. ‚úÖ Trading Engine Import - RESOLVED
**Problem**: Module was placeholder with no actual implementation  
**Solution**: Created full TradingEngine class with database and trading logic  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Module imports and functions correctly

### 3. ‚úÖ Path Configuration - RESOLVED
**Problem**: System expected `/opt/tps19` production path  
**Solution**: Added dynamic path detection supporting both `/workspace` and `/opt/tps19`  
**Status**: ‚úÖ System works in any environment

### 4. ‚úÖ Database Locking - RESOLVED
**Problem**: Test data causing UNIQUE constraints and locks  
**Solution**: Cleaned test data between runs  
**Status**: ‚úÖ All database operations clean
