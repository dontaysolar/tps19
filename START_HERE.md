## 🎓 Key Concepts

### SIUL Decision Process
```
Market Data → 5 AI Modules → Weighted Scores → Final Decision

Modules:
1. Market Analyzer (25%) - Price & volume
2. Risk Assessor (20%) - Risk levels
3. Pattern Detector (20%) - Technical patterns
4. Sentiment Analyzer (15%) - Market sentiment
5. Trend Predictor (20%) - Trend forecasting

Decision:
- Score > 0.7 = BUY
- Score < 0.3 = SELL
- 0.3-0.7 = HOLD
```

### Risk Management
```
Position Sizing:
- Max 10% of portfolio per position
- Max 2% risk per trade
- Max 5% daily loss

Stops:
- Stop-loss: 2% below entry
- Take-profit: 4% above entry
- Trailing stops (future)
```

### Trading Flow
```
1. Market data arrives (every 30s)
2. SIUL analyzes (5 modules)
3. AI Council votes
4. Risk Manager checks limits
5. Trading Engine executes (simulation)
6. Position tracked
7. P&L calculated
8. Learn from outcome
```

## 🔧 Configuration Guide

### Environment Variables (.env)
```bash
# Paths
TPS19_HOME=/opt/tps19        # Installation directory

# Mode
TPS19_ENV=simulation         # simulation/predeployment/production
TPS19_DEBUG=true            # Enable debug logging

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Tests
```bash
# Full system test
python3 tps19_main.py test

# Expected output:
# ✅ PASSED siul
# ✅ PASSED patch_manager
# ✅ PASSED n8n
# 🎯 OVERALL: 3/3 tests passed
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Start system
python3 tps19_main.py

# Watch logs
tail -f logs/system.log

# Check databases
ls -lh data/databases/

# View positions
sqlite3 data/databases/trading.db "SELECT * FROM positions;"
```

---

## 💻 Example Usage

### Place a Trade
```python
from modules.trading_engine import trading_engine, OrderSide

# Buy Bitcoin
result = trading_engine.place_order(
    symbol='BTC/USD',
    side=OrderSide.BUY,
    amount=0.01  # 0.01 BTC
)

print(f"Trade: {result['status']}")
print(f"Price: ${result['price']:.2f}")
```

### Check Portfolio
```python
# Get all positions
positions = trading_engine.get_all_positions()

# Calculate value
portfolio = trading_engine.get_portfolio_value()
print(f"Total Value: ${portfolio['total_value']:.2f}")
print(f"Total P&L: ${portfolio['total_pnl']:.2f}")
```

### Access Configuration
```python
from modules.utils.config import config

# Get settings
is_simulation = config.is_simulation
exchange = config.exchange
max_position = config.get('trading.max_position_size')

print(f"Mode: {'Simulation' if is_simulation else 'Live'}")
print(f"Exchange: {exchange}")
print(f"Max Position: {max_position*100}%")
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"ModuleNotFoundError"**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**"Permission Denied: /opt/tps19"**
```bash
# Use workspace instead
export TPS19_HOME=$(pwd)
```

**"Database locked"**
```bash
# Check for other running instances
ps aux | grep tps19
kill <pid>
```

**"API rate limit"**
```
CoinGecko free tier: 10-50 calls/minute
System waits automatically - this is normal
```
